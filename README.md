# Feedback app

_This is a simple app for learning purposes. It will be complete functional, but we discourage its use in production environments._

## About

This app follows Front End Mentor's challange. FE mentors gives you a list of requeriments and visual assets to follow. They don't give you any code example at all. All source code is open source, but is completly created by repository owner.

## Technologies

For developing this app we're using:

- React
- Vite
- Styled Components
- React Router
- Redux
- Jest
- React Testing library

At first, this app will be a Front End app with a simple mocked backend. Later, we're going to add some back end and authentication.
